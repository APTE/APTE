-Correction of a bug in the parser with the tuples.
-Addition of a module for statistic on the matrices generated by the algorithm
-New strategies for the algorithm available (see the different new options)
-An log option have been added that stores the tree of matrices. It should help following the generation of matrices by the algorithm.
-The help menu have been changed to match all the new options
-Addition of new examples.

0.3.2.beta

0.3beta:

-Major modifications in the source code including the interfaces
