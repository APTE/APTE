#APTE : Algorithm for Proving Trace Equivalence
Version : 0.4beta-RED

********************************
This repository contains an ongoing work: implementing the optimized semantics defined in this [paper](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-54792-8_1) in APTE.

There is one branch per optimized semantics:

1. optim-compression: compressed semantics
2. optim-c+r: reduced semantics

The branch bench_ref corresponds to the reference version (without optimization) used in benchmarks.
The branch benchmark contains routines and results of benchmarks.

3. Uninstall

********************************

###1. Installation

To install **APTE**, first reach the extracted directory APTE-v0.4beta, then enter the following commands:

1. cd Source
2. make

Once the installation is done, an executable 'apte' is created in the directory main directory APTE-v0.4beta

###2. Usage

#####Synopsis :

	apte [-debug high|low|none] [-unfold] [-no_comm] [-no_erase] [-verbose [<int>]] [-display traces|size|step]
	[-log <int>] [-with_por [compr|red] [improper] [nouse]] file

#####Options :

- -debug [high|low|none]

    APTE is programmed with three level of debugging.
    + The High debugging option checks several invariants of the algorithms. While this mode provides more guarantee about the result, it makes the algorithm slower.
    + The Low debugging option only checks basic invariants. 
    + The None debugging option does not check any invariant. (default) Chose this option for optimal running time.

- -display traces : Display symbolic traces that are explored. 

- -display step : Show statistics on the matrices generated by APTE for each main step of the algorithm.

- -display size : Group the statistics on the matrices generated by the size traces.

- -log &lt;int&gt; : Log all the symbolic processes and the matrices obtained on the leaves for all traces of size smaller than or equal to <int>.
-  -with_por [compr|red] [improper] [nouse]: Uses Partial Order Reductions techniques to significantly
          improve performance. It is possible to choose a specific POR technique (compressed
          or reduced semantics), improper and nouse are optional. Without extra argument, -with_por option
          will enable the best POR tehnique (i.e., reduced semantics with improper and nouse).  
**Note** : This option automatically activates the option '-no_comm'.  
**WARNING** : This option should only be used for action-determinate processes.

- -no_comm : Does not consider the internal communication in the trace equivalence.  
**WARNING** : This option should not be used in presence of private channel.

- -no_erase : Does not consider a slight optimisation that consists of removing symbolic processes with the same process during the execution of the algorithm.  
**Note** : This option is automatically activated when -unfold is used.

- -unfold : Use the glutton strategy that consists of unfolding all symbolic traces
          and apply the symbolic equivalence decision procedure for each of them.

- -verbose [&lt;int&gt;] : Display some statistics on the matrices generated at the.
          end of the execution. When an integer &lt;int&gt; is given, the statistics are displayed
          every &lt;int&gt; matrices generated.

###3. Uninstall
